## Description

minghinshi's Adventure is a Minecraft 1.21.1 modpack for players who want a relatively short yet challenging and rewarding experience. Most of the time, you will be exploring structures and dimensions, fighting mobs and bosses, and looting. There is little involvement in technology and magic mods. The modpack has less than 100 mods and can probably run with 2-4 GB of RAM, making it accessible to players with lower-end devices.

In some way, this modpack aims to offer an alternative to difficult "expert" modpacks. However, it will still be challenging to complete. Do you have what it takes to obtain the Sigil of Supremacy?

## Features

Progression revolves around [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis), which divides progression into World Tiers. Reaching milestones unlocks higher World Tiers that offer harder challenges and more loot.

"Staple" adventure mods like the [Twilight Forest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis), [Iron's Spells and Spellbooks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irons-spells-n-spellbooks), and [Cataclysm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lendercataclysm) are lightly tied to progression though remain mostly untouched.

Deliberately fast gameplay. In the beginning, you get a Creative Energy Cell and some storage from [Applied Energistics 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2) for free. [Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones) are free to use.

Around 100 [Quests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-quests-forge) guiding you through progression. Some teach "standard" mods like [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) and [Inventory Essentials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-essentials) to ease beginners of modded Minecraft.
